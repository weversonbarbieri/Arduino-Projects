Arduino Projects

This is the history of Arduino projects since I started in the university, up to now where Iâ€™ve been developing electronic circuits using actuators and sensors. 

The goal of these projects is essentially to build knowledge of microcontrollers, C/C++ language, and the interface between hardware and software.
